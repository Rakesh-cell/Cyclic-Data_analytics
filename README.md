# Cyclic-Data_analytics
**Scenario:**
a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.

**goal:** Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

#Key Findings(using R )

1. Casual riders were found to take longer trips or rides on average than annual Members. This could mean Casual riders used Cyclistic bikes for leisure.
2. Casual riders often ride on weekends whereas annual Members use the program more over the week than on weekends. This could indicate that annual Members are using the bikes to commute to work.
3. Casual riders preferred using electric bikes to other ride types like classic and docked bikes. Annual Members used classic bikes more than other types. The reason Casual riders mostly rode electric bikes could be because they rode longer so, electric bikes eased propulsion.
